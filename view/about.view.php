                    Welcome to Coolhouse, your premier destination for top-quality air conditioning cleaning services with a smile! Founded by a Japanese native who grew up in Cebu, Coolhouse embodies a unique blend of Japanese precision and Filipino warmth.

                    Having spent formative years in Japan, where cleanliness and efficiency are paramount, our founder was inspired by the meticulousness of Japanese air conditioning services. However, upon returning to Cebu, they noticed a stark contrast in the local service industry.

                    Driven by a desire to bridge this gap, Coolhouse was born. Drawing from firsthand experiences and a family lineage deeply rooted in the air conditioning business in Japan, our founder set out to revolutionize the AC service market in Cebu.
